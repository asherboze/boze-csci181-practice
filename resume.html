        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </header>

      <p>
        I was born in Michigan but I grew up in Scobey, Montana. There, I
        learned to love coding, music, and life. In High School, I took a python
        class from Helena, which introduced me to coding. I also performed a few
        sets at the local brewery. I play trombone, guitar, and sing. I know
        Python and am in the process of learning HTML.

        majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Voice.

      <p>
        I worked for the city of Scobey in the Cemetery as a groundskeeper for
        four years and maintained a fleet of cars at Nemont Telephone
        Cooperative for a year. My sophomore year, I worked as a volunteer at
        the Fort Peck Summer Theatre as an actor. I worked for my parents and
        helped them build a house near Fort Peck last winter break.
